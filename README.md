_Hi! The site published here is part of my academic subject.  

Also, other works and skills I have learned (project documentation, prototyping, testing, etc.) are not included here, and I am still continuously learning and improving.
This repository represents part of my journey, not the full picture of my abilities.

Thank you for reading!
